When I was 
a kid I 
went to Europe
. We initially 
landed outside Paris
, then caught 
a connecting flight 
to Amsterdam. 
We then drove 
straight through to 
Luxembourg. For 
our first dinner 
we got steaks 
that came out 
on heated stones 
slabs that were 
used to cook 
the meat, 
except my sister
. 
And so While we 
were ordering we 
were asking what 
some things on 
the menu were 
in English. 
When my sister 
asked what their 
goulash was like
, she misunderstood 
and thought she 
was being asked 
to translate it
. To this 
day we still 
joke around about 
her reply. 
"goulash is 
goulash, translated 
to English it 
is goulash." 
When we were 
looking for our 
hotel my dad 
was driving the 
rental and getting 
very frustrated. 
He ended up 
turning down a 
one way. 
He realized his 
mistake almost immediately
, but it 
was too late
. This is 
definitely the most 
memorable time I 
can remember my 
dad swearing. 
From there We 
headed into Germany 
the next day
. We worked 
our way south 
towards Switzerland. 
On the way 
we stopped in 
a city called 
Rottenburg, a 
Medieval type town 
that had been 
restored after world 
war II. 
There were no 
cars inside the 
walls, everyone 
had to walk 
around. There 
was a very 
large central city 
square that was 
wide open that 
led up to 
a large church
. There were 
all kinds of 
museums around the 
town that covered 
different aspects of 
medieval times. 
You could even 
go up on 
the walls and 
they had inserted 
stones in the 
wall of donors 
names and where 
they were from 
for those that 
contributed money to 
restoring the city
.
